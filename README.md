# Pokedex: Gotta catch-em all!

The [Pokedex: Gotta catch-em all!](https://srivatsanvasudevan.github.io/Pokedex/) website can be used to search for all Pokemon from the Kanto region to the Unova region! You can click on the Pokemon name from the region drop down and learn more information about it!

This project was created using __React__, using concepts like __React Hooks__ and __Axios__ to fetch the information about the Pokemon in __JSON__ format using the __PokeAPI__, __Javascript__, __HTML__ and __SCSS__.
